I have a new preprint online, coauthored with Melissa (now at EPFL in Switzerland) and Rachel. You can view it on bioRxiv:

[Attention reshapes the representational geometry of a perceptual feature space](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.28.672962)

Data and analysis code are also posted on the [project Github repo](https://github.com/denisonlab/attn_geo)
