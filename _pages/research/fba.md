## feature-based attention

Researchers have typically divided up the study of attention into several different _domains_, reflecting the different types of visual information that can be present in the world.
Attention can be directed towards different spatial locations, objects, features, or times, for example.
Feature-based attention refers to how we attend to basic visual features, such as colors, orientations, or motion directions.

In my research, I investigated some fundamental aspects of feature-based attention, such as:

- How broadly or narrowly can we focus our attention to features?

- How is the efficiency of attention affected by the similarity between target and distractor features?

- Can feature-based attention account for the findings of object-based attention?
