## representational geometry and attention

Representational geometry is a computational framework that aims to understand the structure of neural activity and how it relates to processing of different types of information.
One of the key concepts in representational geometry is _similarity_---the idea being that things in the real world that we perceive to be similar are also likely to generate similar patterns of activity in the brain.

Recently, I have been interested in exploring how representational geometry can account for different experimental findings related to attention.
In one line of research, I found that when attending to particular colors, people perceive other colors as being _less similar_ to the target, suggesting that their perception was biased by attention {% cite ChapmanFeatWarp %}.
Extending on this, in my postdoc I have completed a project where we measured how attention affects the representational geometry of orientation {% cite ChapmanTriadAttn %}.

Reviewing a wide range of attention literature, we have also argues that many findings, spanning different domains of attention (spatial, feature-based, etc.), can potentially be unfied within this framework of representational geometry {% cite ChapmanTICS_2024 %}.
