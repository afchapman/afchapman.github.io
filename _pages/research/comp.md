## computational modeling

In my postdoc, I have been working to develop computational models of visual processing that take into account the temporal dynamics of the brain.
We have recently submitted a manuscript for publication where we tested a new model, the Dynamic Spatiotemporal Attention and Normalization model (D-STAN), and measured its ability to reproduce several known non-linear temporal response properties {% cite ChapmanDSTAN %}.

In ongoing work, I am assessing how trade-offs in attention across time might be accounted for by the dynamics of normalization in D-STAN {% cite Chapman_SfN24 %}.

Going forward, I plan to incorporate computational modeling as a core aspect in my research.
I am particularly excited by the idea of modeling the effects of attention in neural populations, and seeing how these changes are related to the perceptual and neural representation of different stimuli.
