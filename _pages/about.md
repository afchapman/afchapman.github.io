Welcome!

I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate working in [Rachel Denison's lab](https://sites.bu.edu/denisonlab/){:target="\_blank"} at Boston University. I received my PhD from UC San Diego in 2022, where I worked in the labs of [John Serences](http://serenceslab.ucsd.edu){:target="\_blank"} and [Viola St√∂rmer](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/stoermerlab/){:target="\_blank"}. Broadly, I am interested in the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception and attention, as well as exploring theoretical and computational aspects of attention.

Before moving to the US for grad school, I received my BSc and BSc (Hons) in psychology, statistics, and mathematics from Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. My early research experience came from working with [Gina Grimshaw](http://www.canlabvuw.wordpress.com){:target="\_blank"} and [Tirta Susilo](http://www.susilolab.org){:target="\_blank"}.
